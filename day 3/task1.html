                <h2>Education</h2>

            <p>I completed my schooling at Sri Sankara Higher Secondary School, where I consistently maintained strong academic performance. I secured 81.6% in my SSLC examination during the academic year 2018–2019, followed by an improved score of 84.97% in my HSC examination during 2020–2021. Building on this solid academic foundation, I pursued my undergraduate studies at Sri Sairam Engineering College in Chennai, specializing in Mechanical and Automation Engineering. Currently, I am in the final year of my Bachelor of Engineering program, with a CGPA of 7.95 out of 10. My education has provided me with a balanced mix of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, particularly in areas related to mechanical systems, automation technologies, and engineering principles. This academic journey has shaped my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, laying a strong foundation for my future career in the engineering domain.</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>During my academic journey, I have worked on impactful projects that combined innovation, problem-solving, and practical application of engineering concepts. One of my key projects, Smart Stairs Platform Enhanced Accessible Solution for Disabled, focused on developing an assistive technology that achieved a 96% accuracy rate in performance forecasting, with enhanced data quality and accessibility improvements. I also contributed to the Smart Automatic Street Lighting System, where I designed an energy-efficient solution using Arduino and sensors to automate brightness control, ensuring scalability and minimal maintenance for urban deployment. These projects reflect my ability to apply technical knowledge creatively to address real-world challenges.</p>
